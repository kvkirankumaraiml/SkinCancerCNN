## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Problem Statement
  Build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. 
- Datasets used: 
	The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
	
## Conclusions
- The training accuracy seems to be nearly ~80%.
- The validation accuracy is nearly ~70%.
- Though the model accuracy has improved, the class rebalance has helped treat the overfitting to some extent.
- Much better models could be built or tried out using more epochs and more layers.
